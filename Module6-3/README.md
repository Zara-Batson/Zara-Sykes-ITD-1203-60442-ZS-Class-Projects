Write a program that determines a student’s grade. It reads three test scores (between 0 and 100) and calls a function that calculates and returns a student’s grade based on the following rules:

    a. If the average score is 90% or more, the grade is A.

    b. If the average score is 70% or more and less than 90%, it checks the third score. If the third score is more than 90%, the grade is A; otherwise, the grade is B.

    c. If the average score is 50% or more and less than 70%, it checks the average of the second and third scores. If the average of the two is greater than 70%, the grade is C; otherwise, it is D.

    d. If the average score is less than 50%, then the grade is F.

The program’s main is to contain only call statements. At least three subfunctions are required: one to read scores, one to determine the grade, and one to print the results.
